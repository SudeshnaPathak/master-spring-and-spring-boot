# 41-react — React quick intro

## Overview

This folder contains a small React-focused demo and notes about JavaScript and tooling used when building Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

## Quick start

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To create a new React app:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Key concepts and commands

- **ECMAScript vs JavaScript**: ECMAScript is the language standard; JavaScript is an implementation.
- **ES7+**: Modern JavaScript versions with new features have made javaScript development easier
- **npm**: Package manager for JavaScript (similar role to Maven/Gradle).
- **npx**: Executes packages without globally installing them.
- **node_modules**: Directory where npm installs project dependencies.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm projects, listing dependencies definitions and scripts.
- `npm init` — initializes a new project and creates `package.json`.
- `npm install <package>` — installs a dependency into `node_modules` and records it in `package.json`.

## About React

- React is a popular component-based library for building SPAs(Single Page Applications) and can be used with React Native for mobile apps & IOS.
- Alternatives include Angular and Vue.js.
- React is Open Source Project created by Facebook
- `create-react-app` is a recommended tool to new new React SPAs quickly.
